# EmailSubjectbasedFileDownload
A scrip that can be used to download files attached to emails with given Subject

I was inspired to create this script when I learned that someone had to manually download and save the files attached to the emails sent by their subordinates. I thought that this was a tedious and time-consuming task that could be automated with a simple script. This is how I came up with the idea and implemented this script.

I plan on doing changes in the future so that this will only check for files in mails sent on the day the script was run or a alteration of this which only checks unread mail.
